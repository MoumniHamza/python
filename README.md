Hello Wolrd !


First Welcome to my Python Github Page , you can fork the repo , add things to it or even break those little programs and start 
them from scratch it is a great way to learn , at least that's the way I learned.

Each .py file is seperate those are small programs that ain't connected to each others.

Some of them use python 2 and others use python 3 but the syntax is not that different I am sure you will be able to figure it out

If you have any questions or suggestions you are more than welcome

Have fun!
